# Titanic-Survival
Conclusions and Recommendations:





Key Findings

1.  Gender

Women had significantly higher survival rates than men.

This confirms the historical "women and children first" policy during evacuation.

Survival Rate:

Women: ~74%

Men: ~18%



2.  Age

Children (especially under 14) had better survival odds.

Seniors and adults had much lower chances, especially if male.



3.  Passenger Class (Pclass)

Class was a major survival factor:

1st Class: ~63% survival

2nd Class: ~47% survival

3rd Class: ~24% survival

1st class passengers were on higher decks and closer to lifeboats.



4. Fare Paid

Passengers who paid higher fares (likely 1st class) had better survival odds.

Fare is highly correlated with class and indirectly with deck position.



5.  Deck/Cabin Location

Upper-deck passengers (Cabins A–C) had higher survival.

Lower decks (F, G) had limited access to lifeboats and lower survival.

Many 3rd class passengers had no cabin records (unknown deck), likely crowded below.



6. Family Size

Passengers with small families (2–4) survived more than those alone or in large families.

Traveling alone had the lowest survival — no one to assist or advocate.



7.  Lifeboat Access (Simulated)

Simulated lifeboat access based on gender, class, and age showed:

High-priority (female, 1st class) passengers had >90% survival.

Low-priority (male, 3rd class) passengers had <20% survival.



8.  Embarkation Point

Passengers from Cherbourg had higher survival — many were 1st class.

Southampton had lower survival — majority were 3rd class.



Recommendations & What Could Have Helped



The Titanic disaster highlighted several critical shortcomings that significantly impacted survival rates. Firstly, the insufficient number of lifeboats, with capacity for only 20 boats, meant that approximately 50% of the passengers and crew could not be accommodated, leading directly to a recommendation for installing lifeboats for 100% capacity on all vessels, rather than just 50%. Secondly, the issue of 3rd class passengers being reportedly trapped below deck indicates a severe inequity in access during emergencies, suggesting the crucial action to ensure equal and unhindered deck access for all passengers, regardless of class. Furthermore, the observation that lifeboats were launched half-full points to a severe lack of preparedness and coordination, emphasizing the need to conduct comprehensive crew training and regular lifeboat drills to maximize rescue efficiency. The heartbreaking reality of lower-class and male passengers being ignored during evacuation underscores a discriminatory and inefficient process, necessitating the implementation of structured, equitable evacuation protocols to ensure fair chances for everyone. The challenge posed by missing cabin information for many passengers hindered effective rescue efforts and tracking, which advocates for keeping better seating and cabin logs for future tracking and emergency management. Lastly, a general lack of communication during the crisis highlighted a critical deficiency in emergency response, leading to the recommendation to improve emergency alert systems and signage to ensure clear and timely information dissemination to all onboard.
